Camel Up: best beta
==================

Camel Up is a fun game from 999 Games in which one of the main goals is to bet on a certain camel. However, it is not always clear what the chances are, since each move of a single camel disturbs the positions of every other camel. This C++ program simply traverses through the tree of possibilities to find out what the chances of winning are for each camel.
